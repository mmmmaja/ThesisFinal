# Binary Classification
* 1 (stable)
* 2 (decliner)

### 1. Feature Selection
* Random Forest (Non-linear feature selection)
* L1 Logistic Regression (Linear feature selection)

### 2. Data Integration

### 3. Training Models
(different models can bring out different interpretations)
* EBM (Interpretable model)
* Logistic Regression (with Elastic Net - l1 and l2 regularization)

### 4. Pathway Analysis & Interpretation
* Proteomics - String DB (has pathway enrichment analysis)
* Metabolomics - MetaboAnalyst / IMPALA
* Lipidomics - need to find correct names first (reach out to Valentin)

Tasks:
* PLS vs logistic regression
* sPLS vs lasso / elastic net
* **concatenated sPLS vs Diablo**
* Tune PLS-DA model

**22.04** make presentation, what done so far and highlights for the future
